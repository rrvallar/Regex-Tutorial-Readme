# Regex Tutorial Application

(by: Robert Vallar )

This tutorial will explain regular expression or Regex. Regex is a set of characters that specifies a search patternomf text. This may include search finding algorithms such as "find" or "find and replace."

# Anchors

Regex begins with /b. This is canned an anchor. The purpose of this is to set a boundary. Using this at the beginning and end of a word, only the text within the anchors are searched for. An example being if the Regex was \b123456\b, then only 123456 would match up but not 1234567.
